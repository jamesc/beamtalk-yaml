# Copilot Instructions for yaml

This is a [Beamtalk](https://www.beamtalk.dev) project that compiles to the BEAM virtual machine.

## Key Conventions

- Source files use `.bt` extension and live in `src/`
- Tests use BUnit (TestCase subclasses) and live in `test/`
- Build output goes to `_build/` (gitignored)
- Package manifest is `beamtalk.toml`

## Beamtalk Syntax

- Smalltalk-inspired message passing: `object message`, `object message: arg`
- Blocks are closures: `[:x | x + 1]`
- Use `//` for line comments
- Implicit returns (last expression is the return value)
- Use `^` only for early returns, never on the last expression
- Newlines separate statements (no periods)

## Build Commands

```bash
beamtalk build    # Compile the project
beamtalk repl     # Start interactive REPL
beamtalk test     # Run tests
```

## MCP / Live Workspace

`.mcp.json` configures the `beamtalk` MCP server. In Claude Code it starts
automatically. Call `describe` first, then `load_project` to load all source.
Use `evaluate`, `test`, `inspect`, and `show_codegen` to interact with a live
REPL rather than inferring behaviour from source. See `AGENTS.md` for the
full tool list and development workflow.
